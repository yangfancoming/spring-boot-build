 * implementation {@link OrderedHealthAggregator} sorts {@link Status} instances based on
 * a priority list.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to add more complex {@link Status} types to the system. In that case
 * either the {@link OrderedHealthAggregator} needs to be properly configured or users
 * need to register a custom {@link HealthAggregator} as bean.
