/**
 * Indicates that a field in a {@link ConfigurationProperties} object should be treated as
 * if it were a nested type. This annotation has no bearing on the actual binding
 * processes, but it is used by the {@code spring-boot-configuration-processor} as a hint
 * that a field is not bound as a single value. When this is specified, a nested group is
 * created for the field and its type is harvested.
 * <p>
 * This has no effect on collections and maps as these types are automatically identified.
